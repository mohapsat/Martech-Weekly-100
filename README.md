## Most Bought and Read Marketing Books of the Week

*Martech Weeklyâ„¢ ranks marketing books each week according to the number of copies sold and pre-ordered through leading online book stores. Bulk buys are counted as a single purchase.*

**MARTECH101** is a fully automated service / catalog that consolidates and indexes books from multiple online book stores, and returns the ones that are most sold and read during a given week. I found the existing lists for e.g. NY Best Sellers, Amazon Charts are pretty limited and thus decided to spin up a small project of my own primarily for my consumption. The list of books is fetched from Amazon and the Newsletter which are completely driven by APIs, and automated to deploy weekly.

- Data provider(s) - Amazon Product Service API
- Indexing and searching powered by Algolia
- Mailchimp API v3 for subscription
