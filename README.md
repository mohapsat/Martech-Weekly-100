# MARTECH101

**MARTECH101** is a fully automated service / catalog that consolidates and indexes books from multiple online book stores, and returns the ones that are most sold and read during a given week. I found the existing lists for e.g. NY Best Sellers, Amazon Charts are pretty limited and thus decided to spin up a small project of my own primarily for my consumption. The list of books being fetched from across all the stores and the newsletter which are completely driven by APIs and automated to deploy weekly.

- Data providers - Amazon, Apple iBooks, Google Books
- Indexing and searching powered by Algolia
- Mailchimp API v3 for subscription
